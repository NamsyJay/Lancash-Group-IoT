## Lancash-Group-IoT
This Project is a POC for Lancash Group; The Company is implementing an IoT System to monitor devices in their Healthcare and Farm.

This Project structure allows for secure, scalable data collection from edge devices, real-time processing, centralised analytics, and integration with both user-facing apps and enterprise systems (SAP). It demonstrates layered, modern architecture principles-separating edge, process, data lake and experience while ensuring third-party observability and privacy solutions.
